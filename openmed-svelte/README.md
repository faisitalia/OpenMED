# OpenMed - Client

Our Client is build with SvelteKit, a new powerful toolkit for building Svelte applications that includes routing, server-side rendering, and much more. Our styling is mainly done via TailwindCSS.

## Try out the client on your local machine

Locate yourself in this directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, just run the client:

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

This command will start the client in development mode onto the `3000` port and open your browser to see the client in action _in development mode_.


> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.


## Building

Note. the following doc is auto generated by Svelte.
It'll be useful for later documentation on how to install the production version of the client.
WIP.

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```
