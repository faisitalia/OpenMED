# OpenMED

## Overview

It is a technological platform to support the patient associations participating in the project.
It is not intended to replace "enterprise"telemedicine applications
It can be used to validate "hybrid" care models that employ videoconferencing and face-to-face visits
It also enables remote working in the healthcare sector, making it possible for doctor-patient interaction even from places other than care facilities.

## Scope

- It allows organizations that do not have the financial and technological resources necessary to acquire enterprise-level solutions
- Avoid the use of consumer technologies such as WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom, Google drive, Dropbox and the like that are not created for the processing of health data
- Volunteers adhering to FAIS and other partner associations are equipped with work tools (smartphones and tablets) that will allow them to interact with each other and with patients to share experiences and provide support through the OpenMED platform.

All useful information on setting up the development environment and installing is available  [here](./v2.0.0.md).
